About QPasm / LibPASM
---------------------

The PASM Library (LibPASM) provides a simple pseudo-assembler interpreter. This library provides the building blocks for creating a small Integrated Development Environment for small pseudo-assembler programs.

QPasm makes use of the PASM Library to provide a small Integrated Development Environment for small pseudo-assembler programs.

Both LibPASM and QPasm are being developed by Wesley Stessens.

QPasm implements the same basic pseudo-assembler language as the one being taught in the first year at Hasselt University in the course "Computer systems". The only difference is that the implemented language in QPasm also supports labels to make programming easier.

QPasm is primarily meant to be a replacement for the older (and buggy) SCASM which is currently being used for the course.

Icons by Oxygen Team
--------------------

The icons that are used by QPasm were created by the Oxygen Team for KDE 4. The Oxygen icons are also released under the LGPL version 3. You can use Subversion to check out all Oxygen icons as SVG if you would like to use them yourself: svn co svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/kdesupport/oxygen-icons
